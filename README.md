# Mapbox Bing Demo
**[Tutorial on my blog](http://anjithsasindran.in/blog/2015/11/29/mapbox-bing-demo/)**

Every developer first things about Google Maps SDK, before thinking about any third party Map's SDK. Well Mapbox is a third party SDK which is available for Android, iOS and the web. In Mapbox you can choose a map style or completely customize your own map, add custom marker points, satellite imagery etc. The main idea behind Mapbox is flexibility.

Read my blog to know about this project in detail. I am using Mapbox for maps, Bing Maps API for geocoding location, Retrofit for making HTTP Requests and Gson for parsing.
